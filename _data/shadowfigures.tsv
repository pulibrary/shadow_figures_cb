1452			Text	Chinese Catalog. Small handwritten catalog booklet and envelope referred to in database as Ch. Cat. Envelope: pencil cursive note: “List of plays arrived with Shadow Play figures”; typewritten: “Dr. Nancy Lee Swann, 20 Nassau Street”. This American made envelope is of later date than the Chinese made booklet, and the handwriting could be NLS. Vertical characters on left side of 9 ½ inch tall booklet cover read: 得心應手 (The hand moves as the mind wishes) and at bottom center:？廷记, recorded by [ting ?] [?court of a great ruler] Hand sewn binding encloses 24 folded pages preprinted with ten red columns per page. The characters 貴胄法政學堂 [The Law and Government School of the Sons of the Nobility] are folded in half as they are at the outer edge of the pages. Altogether twelve pages and one column on the following page are completely filled with information, followed by the unused pages. Fairly legible script written with brush and ink. [A used brush was found within the collection.] There are also check marks in red pencil above entries. Noted in pencil on a small piece of paper, possibly in NLS’s hand: “ means Dr. Chung has located”. A few corrections in blue pencil, erasures, and small marks are also evident. The catalog of shadow figures and properties is organized according to a system. Each column, in most instances, has two entries consisting of an abbreviated description and a number. Pieces are identified as a type of clothing, head, creature, or property followed by a number indicating the quantity of that type of object. The catalog begins with four sets of different colored dragon robes and the final entry, consisting of 28 pieces, is for a grand event involving marriage. This catalog was discovered well along in the process of identifying the collection for the database. Numerous notes found within the collection correlated exactly with catalog entries, but many did not. In brief, the Chinese catalog, while helpful and interesting, is not an exact record of the Gest Collection of shadow figures and properties.

1453	16	3.1481	Property	Burning Pillar and Figures property. Black pillar with red flames flaring at base and top. Two partially visible, half clothed figures climbing on either side, top one: full face, black hair hanging down, lower red trousers, ¾ face hair hanging down. Both hinged to pillar so that they can completely disappear behind it and pillar appears empty. Hinged red flames at mouth of oven door. Metal pin inserted near top of pillar can attach this property to the scrim. Base, or stove, is hinged to chimney pillar in 3 places.	See Broman for similar piece with three climbing figures, p. 103, ex 161, labeled huo zhu 火炷. “The burning pillar was one of the punishments of the Second Hell, governed by Ch’u Chiang Wang 楚江王 (Doré vol. VI pp. 175-176).” Simon notes other pieces (148-169, 201:2, 7) “occur in the play Yu ti yüeh [You di yue] 遊地嶽, the text of which is, however, missing. The building is part of the palace belonging to Yen Lo Wang 閻羅王, the President of the Fifth Court in the Chinese Hades, which has ten hells, each with its own sovereign. The fifth hell is thus governed by Yen Lo Wang (Yen Lo or king Yama). There are also various inscriptions on the palace (Werner:1 pp. 499-501, 591-592; Asiatic pp. 249, 364, 374; and Werner:2 pp. 267, 268, 328-329).”	H: 22 ½ x 7.

1454	16	3.1482	Property	Pillar and Split figure property. Black pillar with red ovoid tip. Full frontal figure wearing blue trousers rolled up to knees stands or falls in half on either side of pillar, having been already split in half. Each half has loose hair, wide eye, unhappy mouth, hinged arm, bloody at center cut, fingers outstretched, red band at ankle, all toes. Small flap of rawhide sewn to pillar just above the head. When it is tucked under, both halves of the figure are stabilized in a standing position. Strings attached at each shoulder when pulled cause arms to raise upwards. Figure can appear unsplit with arms down or up. Another action, possibly caused by pulling or releasing string, allows both halves to fall on either side of pillar, but not flat to the ground; alternately one half can fall while other remains standing. A string is attached at the center of the shoulder string for manipulation.		H: 12 ¾ pillar; 8 ¾ figure.		DSCN4296.JPG|DSCN4297.JPG|DSCN4298.JPG	1454|1454|1454	YES|YES|YES

All three figures can suddenly appear from nowhere by the pulling of strings attached to black shapes cut larger than the dimensions of each figure, but exposing any blades. These are kept in place by rawhide flaps sewn to mountain. Sewn hinges allow entire piece to fold into three pieces.	See Broman for similar piece (including impaled black dog), p 101 ex 152 Dao Shan 刀山, “According to Doré vol. VI, p. 179, this punishment – the sharp rocks – took place in the eighth sub-hell of the Fourth Hell, governed by Wu Kuan Wang 五官王.” See color photo at back.	H: 28 x 25, folds to 14 ¾ x 17 ¾.
