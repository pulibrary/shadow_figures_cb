Small flap sewn on at exact location to hold flipped up lily foot, foot easily slips under it and platform shoe is stable. Very clever. Note: Figure can be either sex, or have one foot of either. I have never seen hinged feet and want to know the play. Martin suggests that figure is really female impersonating a male, because reverse is not possible or likely due to foot size. 1 rod.",

Envelope: pencil cursive note: “List of plays arrived with Shadow Play figures”; typewritten: “Dr. Nancy Lee Swann, 20 Nassau Street”. This American made envelope is of later date than the Chinese made booklet, and the handwriting could be NLS. Vertical characters on left side of 9 ½ inch tall booklet cover read: 得心應手 (The hand moves as the mind wishes) and at bottom center:？廷记, recorded by [ting ?] [?court of a great ruler] Hand sewn binding encloses 24 folded pages preprinted with ten red columns per page. The characters 貴胄法政學堂 [The Law and Government School of the Sons of the Nobility] are folded in half as they are at the outer edge of the pages. Altogether twelve pages and one column on the following page are completely filled with information, followed by the unused pages. Fairly legible script written with brush and ink. [A used brush was found within the collection.] There are also check marks in red pencil above entries. Noted in pencil on a small piece of paper, possibly in NLS’s hand: “ means Dr. Chung has located”. A few corrections in blue pencil, erasures, and small marks are also evident. The catalog of shadow figures and properties is organized according to a system. Each column, in most instances, has two entries consisting of an abbreviated description and a number. Pieces are identified as a type of clothing, head, creature, or property followed by a number indicating the quantity of that type of object. The catalog begins with four sets of different colored dragon robes and the final entry, consisting of 28 pieces, is for a grand event involving marriage. This catalog was discovered well along in the process of identifying the collection for the database. Numerous notes found within the collection correlated exactly with catalog entries, but many did not. In brief, the Chinese catalog, while helpful and interesting, is not an exact record of the Gest Collection of shadow figures and properties.",

When it is tucked under, both halves of the figure are stabilized in a standing position. Strings attached at each shoulder when pulled cause arms to raise upwards. Figure can appear unsplit with arms down or up. Another action, possibly caused by pulling or releasing string, allows both halves to fall on either side of pillar, but not flat to the ground; alternately one half can fall while other remains standing.
